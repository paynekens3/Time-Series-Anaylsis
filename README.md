## Overview
This repository contains code and exercises related to statistical modeling using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) dataset. The exercises include predicting pregnancy length, the number of children, and marital status using regression models, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Poisson regression, and Multinomial Logistic Regression. These exercises were part of the DSC 530 course and demonstrate the application of statistical models to real-world data.

## Data
The dataset is based on the NSFG 2002 data. It includes variables such as pregnancy length, number of children, marital status, and socio-economic indicators.

## Exercises
1. Exercise 11-1: Predicting Date of Birth
In this exercise, we model the pregnancy length based on available factors like whether it's a first birth, race, and number of living children, to predict the date of birth for a pregnancy. The regression model used was OLS (Ordinary Least Squares).

2. Exercise 11-3: Poisson Regression for Number of Children
In this exercise, Poisson regression was applied to predict the number of children born based on age, race, income, and education level. The model helps estimate the expected number of children for a woman based on demographic characteristics.

3. Exercise 11-4: Multinomial Logistic Regression for Marital Status
A multinomial logistic regression model was built to predict a womanâ€™s marital status (married, cohabitating, separated, divorced, etc.) based on her age, race, education, and income. The model provides probabilities for each marital status category given the input features.
